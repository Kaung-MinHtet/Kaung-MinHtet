I'm a **Backend Web Developer** specializing in **Laravel**! 💻 I focus on building secure, efficient, and scalable APIs and server-side applications, with a deep love for the **Laravel** ecosystem. I also work with **React** on the frontend when building full-stack applications, but backend is where I truly thrive.
